### What is Memory Leak?

```
Objects which are no longer required and garbage collector unable to remove them,
consumes heap memory contributing to memory leak.
 
It is responsibilty of Garbage collector to free heap memory from such objects.

Objects which are actually referenced but are unused keep consuming heap memory and contributes to memory leak
```
